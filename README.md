## To use 
1. Accept microphone usage, allow it to use the default recording/input device! And then changed the input device as needed to get the desired audio source.
	- For example: Windows 10, Chrome: Set default recording device to Stereo Out OR Choose Stereo Out from Chrome microphone settings.
2. Play audio, click through to view different visualizations! 
	- Some are interactive, so try moving the mouse around and hitting space bar on some of those visualizations, especially the ones that appear blank!
    
## To Do
- Clean up JS code style to be consistent and up to standards.
- Optimize visualizations to have both a) more unique/pleasing color palletes and b) smoother transitions between animation frames!
- Add a GUI for ease of customizing audio sources
- Restructure Web Audio API usage ? To increase modularity of visualization functions
